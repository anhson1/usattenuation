## USAttenuation: Intrinsic and scattering attenuation for the contiguous U.S.

This repository contains the processing, results and visualization for the following publication:

Tom Eulenfeld and Ulrich Wegler (2017),
Crustal intrinsic and scattering attenuation of high-frequency shear waves in the contiguous United States,
*Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth*, 122,
doi:[10.1002/2017JB014038](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JB014038).

To run the *Qviewer* application offline, clone or download the repository and open the file `visualization/Qviewer/index.html` in a browser.

Content of folders||

`tmp`            | Temporary files
**Processing**   |
`us_prepare.py`  | Download event and station metadata
`us_qopen.py`    | Download waveforms and invert each event for intrinsic and scattering Q

`Qviewer/index.html` | Javascript application to explore all results comfortably. It allows to view results at different stations as a function of frequency. [[link]](https://trichter.github.io/usattenuation)
`how_to.ipynb`       | Jupyter notebook to demonstrate how to use the JSON and georeferenced TIF files. [[link]](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trichter/usattenuation/blob/master/visualization/how_to.ipynb)


## Notes

The scripts use the *Qopen* method. Please browse the corresponding [Qopen Github repository](https://github.com/trichter/qopen) and the reference mentioned therein for more information.

To run the scripts download or clone the repository and install Python3 and `cartopy gdal matplotlib numpy obspy scipy seaborn shapely shove qopen`. This can be easily achieved with anaconda:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda create -n usattenuation python=3 cartopy gdal obspy seaborn shapely statsmodels
conda activate usattenuation
pip install shove qopen
```

After that, create the tmp folder. If you want to run the `us_prepare.py`, `us_qopen.py` or `us_plot_fits.py` scripts it is also necessary to create the data folder and subfolders:

```
mkdir tmp
mkdir data data/events data/stations data/waveforms
```

Before running `us_qopen.py` or `us_plot_fits.py`, you need to download the metadata with `us_prepare.py` script. The other scripts can be run independently and recreate the files in `results` folder and the images for the *Qviewer* application in `visualization` folder.
